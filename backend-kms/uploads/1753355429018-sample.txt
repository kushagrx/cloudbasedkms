Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. 
The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

As technology continues to advance, AI is being integrated into various industries including healthcare, finance, education, and transportation. 
AI systems are helping doctors diagnose diseases more accurately, enabling personalized learning experiences for students, and even powering self-driving cars.

However, alongside these benefits come challenges such as ethical concerns, potential job displacement, and the need for strict regulatory frameworks. 
Despite these concerns, AI is expected to play an increasingly significant role in shaping the future of human society.
